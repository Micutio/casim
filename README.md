Library for creating 2D cellular automata and complex automata in Rust

## What is a Cellular Automaton?

A cellular automaton (short: CA) is a grid of cells where each cell changes it's state depending on those
of its neighbors.

## What is a Complex Automaton?

A complex automaton combines a cellular automaton with an agent-based simulation that operates
on the cellular automaton grid.

## Goal

The goal of this library is to offer a comprehensive tool chain for simulations based on both
of these models.
